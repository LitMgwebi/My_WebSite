                        I have always wanted to strive for the best in my life and the lives of those around me.
                        This drive for the best has spurred me on to accomplish atypical feats in my life that have given me a huge sense of pride.

                        This drive I refer to has motivated me to graduate from high school at the age of sixteen while learning the difficult Cambridge curriculum.
                        I was the third person of my school to pass all their AS level exams when we converted from the national curriculum to the Cambridge curriculum.
                        The difficulty of the work we had done in high school allowed me to sail pass my first year in university with 3 distinctions.

                        Since this year I only had two modules to complete, I was given a lot more freedom with what I wanted to do and investigate,
                        so I dived deeper into JavaScript and the amazing stuff there. My mentor recommended NodeJS and Typescript, a superset of JavaScript,
                        as an interesting place to start. Six months later, I have progressed from NodeJS and Typescript to VueJS, ReactJs, MongoDB (and a bit of PostgreSQL)
                        and Docker. I am also fluent in C#, HTML, ASP.Net, CSS and a bit of PHP due to my current academics at Nelson Mandela University.
                        I also became an intern at Tial Technologies this year. The work I’ve done there has given me an extensive insight into the art and importance of testing.
                        I’m usually tasked with many types of testing, including unit, white-box, black-box, sanity, stress, functional, performance, integration, load, non-functional and acceptance testing.
